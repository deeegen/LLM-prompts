## Best-of-N (BoN) Jailbreaking is a black-box algorithm that bypasses AI model safeguards by repeatedly sampling augmented prompt variations—such as random capitalization or shuffling—until a harmful response is elicited, exploiting the model's sensitivity to input variations.
### This method jailbreaks text, video and audio AI models!
