# LLM-prompts

## Overview  
This repository is a curated collection of prompts for Large Language Models (LLMs), providing templates, techniques, and examples to guide generative AI toward better, more consistent outputs. Prompt engineering‚Äîthe practice of crafting and structuring instructions to elicit desired behavior from an AI model‚Äîis central to this collection :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}. Large language models are neural-network systems pre-trained on vast text corpora that predict and generate human-like text based on those prompts :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

## Repository Structure  
- **`my prompts/`**  
  Custom-created prompts tailored for specific workflows, experiments, and personal projects.  
- **`others/`**  
  A library of publicly found prompts sourced from blogs, academic articles, community forums, and other open resources.  
- **`Dynamic Chain-of-Thought Process.md`**  
  A step-by-step guide for implementing dynamic chain-of-thought prompting to enable iterative, self-refining reasoning.

## Disclaimer
