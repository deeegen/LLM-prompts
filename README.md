# 🧠 LLM Jailbreaks & Prompt Hacks Collection

## 📘 What’s This About?  
Welcome! This repo is your go-to spot for prompt jailbreaks, prompt hacks, and creative techniques designed to push Large Language Models (LLMs) beyond their usual limits. Instead of just straightforward prompts, here you'll find ways people have engineered inputs to bypass restrictions, unlock hidden behaviors, or steer LLMs in unexpected directions.

Prompt jailbreaks are all about crafting instructions that let you “break out” of normal constraints and explore what these models can really do — whether it’s creative problem-solving, exploring taboo topics, or generating unique outputs that standard prompts won’t allow.
