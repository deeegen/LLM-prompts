# 🧠 LLM Prompts Collection

## 📘 Overview
Welcome to the **LLM Prompts** repository—a curated library of templates, techniques, and examples designed to help you get more consistent and effective results from Large Language Models (LLMs).  

Prompt engineering—the art of crafting inputs to guide model behavior—is the foundation of this collection. LLMs are neural network-based systems trained on massive text datasets to generate human-like responses.
